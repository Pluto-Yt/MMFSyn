## 1. Introduction
This is the detailed code and usage guide for the MMFSyn model, as featured in the research paper titled "MMFSyn: a multimodal deep learning framework for predicting anticancer synergistic drug combinations".
## 2. Usage
### 2.1 Installation
To use MMFSyn you must make sure that your python version is greater than 3.7. If you donâ€™t know the version of python you can check it by:

```python
>>> import platform
>>> platform.python_version()
'3.9.12'
```

### 2.2 Environment Requirement
The required packages are as follows:
- PyTorch==1.11.0
- PyTorch-Geometric==2.0.4
- numpy==1.22.4
- scikit-learn==1.1.1
- rdkit==2022.03.2
### 2.3 Dataset
We use the common dataset, namely, the large-scale collaborative dataset published by O'Neil et al. as the benchmark dataset for training and evaluating the model. This dataset covers a total of 23052 pieces of data from 39 cancer cell lines in 7 tissues with 583 different drug combinations. There are 38 drugs in this dataset, consisting of 24 FDA approved drugs and 14 experimental drugs.
### 2.4 Quick Start
First, you need to be in the ~/MMFSyn/predictor file directory, and then run the following code:

```python
python data_creation.py
```

Then run the following code:

```python
python training.py
```
